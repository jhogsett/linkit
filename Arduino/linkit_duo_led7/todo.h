// crash annunciator switching from wheel with next window to wheel wit position only 

// have a sequencer that runs to one side, stops, and has to be triggered to continue to the other side


// allow setting the current value of a sequencer (to allow multiple ones running that are offset from each other)

// make sure sequence parameters can be changed without resetting


// documentation to wiki

// goals: 
// sequence crawling from zone to zone (triggers) 
// move a sequencing zone back and forth slowly (value safety upon arbitrary changes)
// something speeding up and slowing down (should be able to adjust schedule timing without it resetting)


// test could highlight differences between strings to reduce need to manually diff them 



// for palette rotation, maybe specify how many colors to involve in rotation, such as 6


// for dynamically changing scheduler timing, make sure changing the time can be done without reseting it

// could have an arg command that does various stuff
// examples:
//   0:arg - restore previous arg0
//   1:arg - restore previous arg0, arg1
//   2:arg - 

// maybe keep math, argument manipulation/recovery separate for simplicity

// what are the useful combinations of argument manipulation?
// arg0 = saved arg0, also arg1=arg0 first
// arg1 = saved arg0
// arg2 = saved arg0

// maybe: 
// 0:arg (upshift)   - arg2 = arg1, arg1 = arg0, arg0 = accum
// 1:arg (downshift) - accum = arg0, arg0 = arg1, arg1 = arg2, arg2 = 0

// use case: need to supply arg0 and arg1 to change color sequence
// need to supply varying arg0 and arg1
//   get the first arg0 - 0:seq  (at this point arg0 receives the next seq #0)
//   get the second arg0 - 1:seq (on "1" argument, accum receives arg0; on "seq" arg0 receives next seq #1
//   shift the arguments up - arg (at this point arg2 receives arg1, arg1 receives arg0, arg0 receives = accum)


// could have sto and rcl
// 0:sto saves arg0,arg1,arg2
// 1:sto saves arg0
// 2:sto saves arg1
// 4:sto saves arg2
// 7:sto saves arg0,arg1,arg2
// 0:rcl restores arg0,arg1,arg2
// 1:rcl restores arg0
// 2:rcl restores arg1
// 4:rcl restores arg2
// 7:rcl restores arg0,arg1,arg2
// PROBLEM: sto and rcl can't take arguments in order to prevent contamination


// when running a macro, like 0:run, could leave arg1 and arg2, then set arg0 = accum, in this way the macro running arg is hidden and arguments can be passed in to the macro


// sto could always store all three arguments, then an argument can be passed to rcl to restore a specific argument using accum to keep arg0
// could do something much simpler:
//   sto: just saves arg0 to accum
//   rcl: just restores arg1 from accum



// can the wheel sequence be switched in direction?

// could have 8-bit versions of sequencers for speed


// need triggers, want the cosine swing and wheel to trigger other ones
//   also need one-time action sequencers
//   could set trigger macros per type of sequencer

// trigger idea: when filling up and ran out of open positions

// to sequence hsl color sweep starting angle, need the output of the sequencer to be in arg1 wit arg0 being a fixed value
// --> maybe reverse the arguments? might be more likely to sequence the starting angle instead of the step angle

// sequencer will leave value in arg0, how to get it into arg1?
// another sequencer type?

// arg command: shifts args up and puts values in arg0
// for instnace: existing values are 1,2,3, then 120:arg, now they're 120,1,2
// 120,5:arg would produce 120,5,1


// rep doesn't seem to be repeating effects

// replace getters/settings with C macros

// rst should not set display back to zero

// introduce setting for "primary" and "secondary" display so the particular display can be changed in real time outside of running program

// could expand rev command into insertion/operation mode and add things like: xor-remixed position insertion, other insertion modes

// ideas for reducing code footprint
// remove getters/settings and use variables directly (maybe with a special naming convention so they stand out)
// remove the individual color commands and use the palette only
// cache dereferenced array element pointers
// remove commands that are effecively the same like rep and cpy (keep cpy)
// remove overly-protective guard code
// move additional settings to the cfg command
// remove low-use commands/features
// segment features so they can be enabled/disabled easily
// DRY up the blink code
// remove the range of blink commands and set with an argument
// combine the various switch statements in dispatch command back to single switch 
// could switch the test code in/out 
// remove all floating point constants / math
// pass a pointer to dependencies instead of passing individual arguments if/where possible
// convert setters/getters into macros


// modify clr to reset config to defaults

// a mode when doing random position: only even, or only odd, or only mod N


// -1,0:pal could do random palette color, -1,5:pal do random within first 5 colors


// for sequencers, use simple byte versions of the range fits 0-255 for speed

// need to be able to manipulate arguments
// example: quantize (to allow position offsets)
// also: combine two separate random numbers into arg0, arg1


// ----- IDEAS --------------------------------------------------------------
// could build upon macros to form the concept of apps
// apps:
// - have a way to start up
// - have a way to shut down
// - perhaps other common behaviors

// could have an effect that runs a macro at render time to do whatever it wants, with the rendering pixel as the current window
// - this could be very slow
// - perhaps call the macro one time per scan line rather than per incidence of effect in buffer
//
// - example of use: 
//   - could have a dynamic display without needing to have a macro running all the time
// --> beginning of rendering could be a trigger

// palette: shift, rotate, sweeps that modify existing palette





// ------ COLORS --------------------------------------------------------------
// add a 15,15,15 gray
// add high pressure sodium vapor lamp

// water other recognizable colors are common?
// xenon white
// argon purple
// green light green
// yelllow light amber

// add remaining 5's colors (they may be took dark)



// cfg command - signal to reset to default config value



// shf: need to rotate and transform palette in various ways

// what if arg1 was the # of steps taken, or the number skipped, and that could be transformed to allow filling gaps

// triggers:
// run a macro each time a sequence has an event (events: start (wheel), start, mid-way (swing))
// how would this work?
//   one trigger per sequencer (so, 6)
//   triggers are built into sequencers, not separate (though a different command is used to set them up)
//   set a trigger: t,s,m:trg 
//     t=trigger number
//     s=sequence number, if s is -1, the trigger is cleared
//     m=macro number, for two-event sequences (swing) it calls this macro and m+1 
//   each sequence incrementer will fire the trigger at bounding events
//   the trigger will then call the macro(s)

// the color commands could be a shortcut to colors in the initial palette instead of fixed values

// hardware triggers, such as button presses, will be called something else, like Actions

// other sequencers:
// brownian motion
// power ease
// seeded random
// gravity bounce
// ones useful in 2D such as triangle wave, spirograph, Lissajous curves

// when using sine sequencer, have a way to fill in missing pixels (missing due to skipping over them in order to speed up)
// -- would need a sequencer that knew how to draw pixels and fill them in
//      have a way for sequencer to accept a macro to run to do the drawing, this is like a trigger
//      it could call the same memory macro as its sequence number, to avoid passing the macro #
//

// maybe alternate between blink, breathe and fade processing to allow scheduling more often

// upon sequencing, leave in arg0 a count of the number of skipped (black) pixels, so a macro could use 'rpt' to fill in  

// maybe rst should clear the arguments
// this is for cases where arg0 is optionally left with a value other than zero after some operation


// specs need to account for swapped colors on strands

// may be able to save space by storing crossfade and ease fractions as an 8-bit values n/255
// -- may allow using integer math instead of floating point math


// divide blink wheel by blink period, for instnace 5999 / 1000 to get 0 through 5, 
//   store that figure and only display blink if it matches effect blink number

// command to run a range of macros, like 20,29:rmm runs macros 20 through 29 in order

// 0,255,255:hsl at 100:lev is less bright than red at 100:lev (hsl brightness compensation problem?)

// palette, need to change brightness up/down, distribute HSL colors various ways

// allow setting a seed value for random number generation
// -- would have to be a private seed (feed value back as seed?) to have a repeatable sequence

// more colors: argon, neon, xenon, sodium

// need a way to set a sequence relatively, like to cover a zone

// need a way to pause background effects but keep schedules running

// ability to set current sequence value to a random number in range

// opposite value doesn't seem to work proper except starting a zero

// ignore out of range sequencer numbers

// need a way to reset all sequncers (-1:seq?)

// need to be able to link sequencers (triggers?)

// have the ability to set drawing mode: overwrite, add, etc.

// concept of "objects"
// - hidden/shown
// - moved around
// - could be as simple as offset + window + color & effect
// - could be a complex pattern like a bell curve of lit leds around a center point

// rng means random number generator, could have a sequential number generator
// 10:seq - sequences numbers 0 - 9 then repeats
// 10:5:set - sequences numbers 5 - 9 then repeats
// 10:5:1:set - sequences numbers 5 - 9, then 8 -6, then repeat
//
// need to be able to have multiple sequencers
// 10:seq - sequences numbers 0 - 9 for sequencer #0 then repeats
// 10:1:seq - sequences numbers 0 - 9 for sequencer #1 then repeats
// 10:2:5:seq - sequences numbers 5 - 9 for sequencer #0 then repeats
// 10:osc - oscillates numbers 0 - 9, then 8 - 1, for oscillator #0, then repeats
// 10:1:osc - same but for osc #1
// 10:2:5:osc - sequences 5 - 9, then 8 -6 for #2 then repeats
//
// might be better if arg0 is the seq/osc #
// then, a call like 1,10:seq sets up a sequencer for 0-9, then a call like 1:seq uses it (1,10:seq would also user it? or would reset it?)
//
// for seq might want a way to stop rather than repeat
//
// could have types: sequence once, sequence circular, sequence oscillatory

// simplest sng
// 10:sng
// 0:sng (arg0 is now zero)
// 0:sng (arg0 is now one) ...


// need to ensure not getting same random color twice in a row (will make things prettier)

// replace color feature

// effect: the color value refers to a palette position not an RGB value
//   this would also allow for 16 extra bits of effects data
//     for instance fading into a color

// where possible, special mode ints should be positive so they can be randomized

// the infinite loop protection could also be a trigger, when all full or all empty
// triggers could be a set of slots that get set to a macro to run when triggers

// could have certain commands that end the macro under certain conditions

// the fade problem is when running from within a schedule. Running a macro N times from another macro works from the command line
// the fade counter only decides when to automatically flush, not the rate at which fading happens; repeated renders will automatically fade the buffer color

// or 10,3,5:seq - allowing the count to be random
// 20:seq - runs macro #0 20 times, with arg0 from 0-19
// 20,1:seq = runs macro #1 20 times
// 20,2,5:seq = runs macro 2 15 times, from 5 to 19
// could have an advance command that sets the position to the next position
// shooting star would be
// 5:set:wht:brt:brt:sfd:flu
// rps - random starting position
// 2:rng:rev - random direction
// 20,1,5:rng - random # between 1 and 19 with arg1 = 5
// seq - sequence arg0 from 0 to n-1 and run macro 5 each time

// could have a non-blinking blink, just display the dim color, for background decoration

// need a way to clear carry color or not set it during a buffer shift

// apply ease animation timing to rotations

// when setting position and placing a rubber stamp, it only places one pixel (which is expected)
// need a way to expand the window to easily place the whole stamp
// for instance, -6:win could mean to expand the current window +6

// would be cool to somehow do mappying where the zone rotations on radius8 could be done on the opposite axis
// with mapping in place you should be able to apply rotations to rows and colums, in fact multiple rows and columns

// would pop/push args be helpful?

// slow fade doesn't work when running a macro repeatedly like 1000,0:run. It works when running it manually over serial.

// - when you set certain values, they stick to the zone you're on

// repeat command doesn't work in reverse

// if macro run more often than fade period, no fading at all happens

// command to restore pre-programmed macros

// would be nice to be able to measure the current usage via an analog pin

// need to be able to have a white flash but then resume the previous color/effect
// - maybe reverts when the luminosity matches so it seems to fade out
// - could have a trigger that could detect the end of fading out; macro would need to know the position
// - there could be a standard after-fade color (default black) 

// could have a random macro command
// 0,2,5:rnm = randomly run 0, 1 or 2, with 5 as arg0

// would be nice if running a macro preserved the original args

// need a command to dump out all the macros

// could have commands that take the rest of the input and do something with them iteratively, like an instant macro
// 9:mac:commands:commands -> would run the commands 9 times
// this could save macro space for one-off special repeat functions

// accum->arg0
// arg0->arg1
// but need arg0 to go to arg2

// need arg0 to be times
// need arg1 to be 1

// arg could do
// rotate args0-2 N times forward (0->1, 1->2, 2->0), then swap arg0 with accumulator 

// arg could:
// preserve the arguments present
// swap accum with 

//:arg            :rot

// visual representation of eeprom memory

// have virtual colors that always point to a position in the palette
// how? colors are stored as RGB
// can't add a flag indicating to treat it as an integer
// could have an effects bit that means get from palette

// improvement: when the input buffer has too many incoming chars
// unget the current building command so it can be gotten next
// or discard the current building command and the rest of the buffer
// or ignore the entire request as potentially truncated (though it's already processed commands)

// take advantage of rest_of_buffer to allow sequencing:
// 10,5:seq:pal:5:rep:flu --> would pass 5 thru 9 as arg[0] to the rest of the command line repeatedly

// would be nice to have a way to choose two colors that look nice together instead of arbitrary colors

// other canned values
// current zone, current offset, current window, current display, current reversal

// modulo could be used to toggle:
// 2:rng:1:add:2:mod

// have a way of setting the second arg to a random number too
  // need to be able to run a macro a random # of times

// rng, leaves # as arg[0]
// rng, sets accum to old arg[0], leaves new # as arg[0]

// now with arg[0] and accum, a command could combine into args,
// args[0] -> arg[1]
// accum -> arg[0]

// 10,5:rng   accum = 0, arg[0] = n 
// 100,1:rng  accum = arg[0], arg[0] = n
// cmb        arg[1] = arg[0], arg[0] = accum

// 10,5:rng:100,1:rng:cmb --> 5-10, 1-100

// 100:cmb -> arg[1] = 100, arg[0] = whatever is in the accum, arg[1] = 100
// or is it more natural that new argument goes to arg[0]?
// could be: the command just sets arg[1] from the accumulator
//
// some calc, accum = old arg[0], arg[0] = result
// some other calc, accum = result #1

// "100" -- arg[0] automatically gets set
// 

// could have sto and rcl commands to save/restore values of arg[0]

// there could be a special delimiter that takes the first byte of the buffer as a pre-looked-up command number

// -- the delimiter is problematic
// instead accept a series of binary bytes of data followed by a special command for storing binary macros
// -- would require holding onto the input buffer (adding this back)

// could use the top 3 bits of the effects array to store the carry bits from color math overruns
// -- could probably get the same results by preventing the numbers from exceeding 0-255

// when setting raw color make sure there's no scaling of stored value
// have an effect that renders the buffer raw without any brightness adjustment

// ci-skip build status is "not_run"
// fade based on build time
// change refresh rate based on time of day (afterhours it doesn't need to check that often)
// show something if the data hasn't updated in a long time
// show something if the data has been unchanged for some time, like after hours

python: 

if there's no new builds, display an alternate low power version
- dim for all the colors
- breathing and blinking still happen normally

seems like it would be better to let the arduino handle the low power rendering so the python script isn't in charge of an effect.

lowpower command means:

 - could be: normal display effects, but all-but-one LEDs are blacked out (or not rendered).
 - the position rendered would vary slowly and go low-high (not back and forth)

 opposite name? normal

 flush can call the alternate low-power rendering 

// Python: also show the high power mode if any of the statuses change
